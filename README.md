This script is based on the popular dfunc-bypasser (https://github.com/teambi0s/dfunc-bypasser) as well as inspired by ippsec's script made during the walkthrough for UpDown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lxWB1Yd0). The additions made to this script from ippsec's version is the feature to not only detect and display what dangerous php function exists, but also to then create a reverse shell off of it. This script works by simply uploading it to a machine that allows for php to execute and then browsing to the uploaded file. Don't forget to have nc -lvnp <IP> up and ready to accept that incoming shell.
